# Project Workshop 4 
### (To be done after completion of Project Workshop 3)

## Customer Management System

### Summary
In a previous phase of the Travel Experts project, web pages were developed to interact with a Node.js backend. This workshop focuses on recreating those pages using C# and ASP.NET Core. The goal is to build a robust customer management system that allows for user sign-up, login, and management of travel products. The transition from Node.js to ASP.NET Core will leverage the strengths of the .NET framework, providing a more integrated and scalable solution for handling customer data and interactions.

### Form 1: Customer Sign-Up and Validation
(✅ - Copy/paste the checkmark as you finish tasks)

✅ Recreate the customer sign-up page to send form data to an ASP.NET page for verification.  
✅ Ensure all required fields are filled in (business phone is optional).  
✅ Validate that the postal code follows the correct Canadian format.  
✅ Ensure the phone number consists of numeric digits and includes an area code.  
✅ Verify that the password is entered twice and both entries match.  
✅ Allow the agent ID to be null when creating a customer record.  

### Form 2: Customer Login and Data Update
(✅ - Copy/paste the checkmark as you finish tasks)

✅ Enhance the customer sign-up page to enable customers to log in.  
✅ Implement user ID and password authentication.  
✅ Allow customers to modify their personal information after logging in.  

### Form 3: Travel Product Listing
(✅ - Copy/paste the checkmark as you finish tasks)

❌ Design a page that enables customers to view the travel products they have purchased.  
❌ Display a price breakdown listing the cost of each package.  
❌ Calculate and show the total cost owing for the purchased products.  

### Form 4: Customer Payment Simulation
(✅ - Copy/paste the checkmark as you finish tasks)

❌ Simulate customer payments using a virtual wallet/card system.  
❌ Associate a credit balance with each customer for payment towards packages.  
❌ Implement a feature that allows customers to use their virtual balance for transactions.  

### Validation Tasks
(✅ - Copy/paste the checkmark as you finish tasks)

❌ Implement data validation for customer sign-up and login.  
❌ Ensure that all validations are user-friendly and provide appropriate error messages.  
❌ Verify that all implemented validations work as expected in the application.  

## Contributions
Each team member is encouraged to contribute to the project. Please document your contributions and workflow in the provided documentation file.

## Deliverables
